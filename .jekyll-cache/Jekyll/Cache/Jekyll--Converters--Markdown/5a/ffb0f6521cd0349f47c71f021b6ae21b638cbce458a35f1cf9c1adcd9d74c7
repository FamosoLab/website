<h3>Postdoctoral Researcher in Quantitive Genetics</h3>
<p><em>Position will be based as a visiting scientist at
LSU AgCenter H. Rouse Caffey Rice Research Station, Rayne, Louisiana</em></p>
<h4>Position Description:</h4>
<p>This position will be part of the applied rice breeding program
at H. Rouse Caffey Rice Research Station with the LSU AgCenter with
Dr. Adam Famoso and work closely with collaborators at Cornell University.
The responsibilities of the position will include development and deployment
of breeding analytics methodologies and tools into an applied breeding program.
The position will build upon a recently developed genomic selection (GS)
infrastructure established for U.S. rice breeding programs and germplasm. Key
focus areas will include developing, evaluating, and deploying methods and tools
related to experimental design, genomic selection, phenotypic analysis, and data
management. The position will work to evaluate the overall breeding process
and identify opportunities to improve the breeding strategy. Designing,
analyzing, and publishing validation studies will be a component of this role.
Success in this position will require a sound understanding of the practical and
logistical considerations of a variety development program and will require an
interest in learning about the day-to-day operations of the breeding program.
The successful candidate must have excellent oral and written communication
skills and is expected to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals.
The LSU AgCenter rice breeding program has a comprehensive field testing
component, winter nursery facilities, and a high-throughput SNP marker lab, and
varieties developed from the program are widely grown across Louisiana and the
Southern U.S. rice production region.</p>
<h4>Qualification Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ph.D. in plant breeding, animal breeding, genetics or related field;
strong background in statistical/quantitative genetics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A understanding of the theoretical and computational methodologies
used to analyze quantitative and molecular data for genomic prediction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong interest in the application of GS to applied variety development
program; ability to work well across teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expertise in statistical programming languages
(R, SAS, MATLAB, etc.) and ability to code in at least one scripting language
(Python, Perl, etc.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The position is based in Rayne, LA, and will include 1-2 trips per year to
Ithaca, NY, pending safe traveling conditions in respect to COVID-19.</p>

</a></p>
<h4>Position Description:</h4>
<p>Responsibilities of the position include developing comprehensive genomic
prediction methodologies and genetic evaluations in the context of an
established, large-scale rice variety development program. This position will
work to develop, validate, and optimize prediction methodologies and procedures
for immediate application in the LSU AgCenter rice breeding program of
Dr. Adam Famoso. The overall research will involve development and
application of statistical models for integrating contemporary genomic and
phenotypic data, leading to optimized breeding strategies involving genomic
selection (GS) and marker-assisted selection. Specific questions may include
training population size and composition, optimal experimental designs,
development of selection indices, development of statistical models that
incorporate weather/climate and proximal sensing data; estimation of cost-benefit
trade-offs associated with the introduction of GS into an existing breeding
program and implementation of multi-year genetic evaluations. The successful
candidate must have excellent oral and written communication skills and is
expected to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals. The LSU AgCenter
rice breeding program has a comprehensive field testing component, winter
nursery facilities, and a high-throughput SNP marker lab.</p>
