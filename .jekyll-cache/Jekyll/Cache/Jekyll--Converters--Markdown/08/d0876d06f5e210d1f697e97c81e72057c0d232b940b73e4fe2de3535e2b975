I"	<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>As a university breeding program, it is our mandate to
conduct high quality peer-reviewed research in our field of breeding and genetics.
Emphasis is on developing and validating new technologies and breeding approaches
within the logistical context of an applied breeding program</p>
<h2>Characterizing the diversity in US rice</h2>
<p>Although rice has served as a  model organism for decades and many genes have been
characterized and cloned, much of this work has been conducted outside of elite
US germplasm. We leaverage the wealth of genomics data available in the rice
community to pinpoint markers for testing in our breeding germplasm.
From there we identify key haplotypes and develop SNP assays
that can be used for marker assisted selection in our program.</p>

<p><strong>Converting rice knowledge into markers that accelerate the production of new
varietie</strong></p>
<p>Our approach has proved fruitful and has led to the development of markers
for a multitude ofquality, agronomic, and disease traits. Check out our work

<h2>Speciality rice for Latin markets</h2>

<p><strong>PhD student Raul Guerra is working to improve rice for the Latin American
export market.</strong></p>
<p>Tastes change over time and it's our duty to make sure we are developing rice
cultivars that not only produce for farmers, but also meet the demands of the
consumer. Export to Central America is a key market for US rice farmers;
however, exports have declined due changing perceptions of grain quality in
these regions. We are working towards developing quantitative methods that can
be used to understand the grain qualities desired in Latin markets. Once we
understand the heritable fraction of these quality traits, we can fastlane the
development of varieties that meet quality standards.</p>
<h2>Realizing the potential of genome-wide markers</h2>

<p><strong>Breeding methods need to take into acount phenotyping capacity and genetic
complexity. Traits in the bottom right of this chart are prime targets for
genomic prediction.</strong></p>
<p>Maker assisted selection can lead to big gains for traits with a simple
genetic architecture like plant height, but often fails to deliver for
polygenic traits like yield or chalkiness. In the early 2000s, statistical
methods for utilizing whole-genome markers to predict complex
traits--like yield--were developed and their use has since become mainstream in
industry breeding programs for high budget crops. We are investigating the use
of genomic prediction within our program in collaboration with the
