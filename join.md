## Now Hiring!

### Postdoctoral Researcher in Quantitive Genetics
*Position will be based as a visiting scientist at
LSU AgCenter H. Rouse Caffey Rice Research Station, Rayne, Louisiana*

#### Position Description:
This position will be part of the applied rice breeding program 
at H. Rouse Caffey Rice Research Station with the LSU AgCenter with 
Dr. Adam Famoso and work closely with collaborators at Cornell University. 
The responsibilities of the position will include development and deployment 
of breeding analytics methodologies and tools into an applied breeding program. 
The position will build upon a recently developed genomic selection (GS) 
infrastructure established for U.S. rice breeding programs and germplasm. Key 
focus areas will include developing, evaluating, and deploying methods and tools 
related to experimental design, genomic selection, phenotypic analysis, and data 
management. The position will work to evaluate the overall breeding process 
and identify opportunities to improve the breeding strategy. Designing, 
analyzing, and publishing validation studies will be a component of this role. 
Success in this position will require a sound understanding of the practical and 
logistical considerations of a variety development program and will require an 
interest in learning about the day-to-day operations of the breeding program. 
The successful candidate must have excellent oral and written communication 
skills and is expected to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals. 
The LSU AgCenter rice breeding program has a comprehensive field testing 
component, winter nursery facilities, and a high-throughput SNP marker lab, and 
varieties developed from the program are widely grown across Louisiana and the 
Southern U.S. rice production region.

#### Qualification Requirements:
* Ph.D. in plant breeding, animal breeding, genetics or related field; 
strong background in statistical/quantitative genetics

* A understanding of the theoretical and computational methodologies 
used to analyze quantitative and molecular data for genomic prediction

* Strong interest in the application of GS to applied variety development 
program; ability to work well across teams

* Expertise in statistical programming languages 
(R, SAS, MATLAB, etc.) and ability to code in at least one scripting language 
(Python, Perl, etc.)

 The position is based in Rayne, LA, and will include 1-2 trips per year to 
 Ithaca, NY, pending safe traveling conditions in respect to COVID-19.

### Postdoctoral Researcher in Quantitive Genetics
*Position will be based as a visiting scientist at
Cornell University, Ithaca, NY in the lab of*
[Dr. Kelly Robbins](https://blogs.cornell.edu/robbinslab/){:target="_blank"}

#### Position Description:
Responsibilities of the position include developing comprehensive genomic 
prediction methodologies and genetic evaluations in the context of an 
established, large-scale rice variety development program. This position will 
work to develop, validate, and optimize prediction methodologies and procedures 
for immediate application in the LSU AgCenter rice breeding program of 
Dr. Adam Famoso. The overall research will involve development and
application of statistical models for integrating contemporary genomic and 
phenotypic data, leading to optimized breeding strategies involving genomic 
selection (GS) and marker-assisted selection. Specific questions may include 
training population size and composition, optimal experimental designs, 
development of selection indices, development of statistical models that 
incorporate weather/climate and proximal sensing data; estimation of cost-benefit 
trade-offs associated with the introduction of GS into an existing breeding 
program and implementation of multi-year genetic evaluations. The successful 
candidate must have excellent oral and written communication skills and is 
expected to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals. The LSU AgCenter 
rice breeding program has a comprehensive field testing component, winter 
nursery facilities, and a high-throughput SNP marker lab.

#### Qualification Requirements:
* Ph.D. in plant breeding, animal breeding, genetics or related field; 
strong background in statistical/quantitative genetics

The position is based in Ithaca, NY, and will require 2-3 trips per year
to Louisiana, pending safe traveling in respect to COVID-19.

## Prospective Graduate Students
The focus of Dr. Famoso's program is rice variety development and research 
related to rice breeding and genetics. Graduate students in the program 
typically  conduct research projects that involve extensive field work in 
addition to a genetics component, and praticipate in other breeding program 
activities. Interested parties should contact Dr. Famoso at
