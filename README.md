# Louisiana Rice Website

This is the website for the LSU rice breeding program. It was created by modifying the Jekyll [Clean Blog](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll) theme with components from the [Hux Blog](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) theme (sidebar and fonts).
